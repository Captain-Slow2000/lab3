Welcome to the home page of my portfolio! From here you will be able to access<br>
the rest of the website through the links put in the header and footer located<br>
at the top and bottom of the webpage.<br><br> 

You can learn more about the website under the About tab. There you can find<br>
even more details about the features and details of this website.<br><br>

You can view the portfolio by clicking the Portfolio link.<br><br>

You can find information to contact me (for security reasons not really)<br>
under the Contact tab, as well as a map leading to my totally legit, not at all fake<br>
address on Broadway. Yeah, I'm impressed with myself too.<br><br>

You can "sign in", or "sign up" under the tabs designated "sign in" and "sign up."<br>
Pretty convenient, if I do say so myself. The website will not actually remember your<br> 
log in information, but the log in table and submit button do function.<br><br> 

Sign in only asks for your username and password, since you have already given other<br>
information to the website.<br><br>

Sign up asks for a little more, such as your name, phone number, email, and mailing address<br>
in addition to a username and password.<br><br>
