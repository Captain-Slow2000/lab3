By using this website, you agree that we now have access to all your information.<br>
You may think, "oh, just my internet information, what could be so wrong about that?"<br>
No, we really do mean all information pertaining to you as a living individual.<br>
This includes your name, age, height, SSN, (genome sequences for when we create a<br> 
clone to replace you), the names of your pets (if you have any), all family members,<br>
the amount of steps you took today, and yesterday, and the day before that, and so forth.<br><br>

Just remember, you clicked on the website out of your own free will, so from the moment you did<br> 
you surrendered all your information to my portfolio website. So you cannot sue us. I think.<br><br> 

Okay, we are not actually collecting any information on you, nor do we intend to.<br>
There is no reason to, nor is it actually a requirement for this assignment.<br> 
Therefore, this website is purely non-malevolent, and will not try to spy on you in any<br>
way.<br><br>

Do you think they bought it? <br><br>

That concludes the privacy policy for this website, thanks for stopping by! Feel free to navigate<br>
