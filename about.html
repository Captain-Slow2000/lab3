Welcome to my portfolio site! This website consists of<br>
multiple different pages, each accessible via links found in the header.<br>
The website is written in HTML 5 with styling done through CSS.<br><br>

There is a header at the top of the main page, which consists of the about page,<br>
which you are currently on, the portfolio itself, a contact form, and pages<br> 
to sign in or sign up for the website. Each page in the html code is supposed to<br>
have a minimum of 10 tags from to change the way the website looks.<br><br> 

In the footer there can be found links to the terms and conditions,<br>
the cookie policy, and the privacy policy. The website does not actually<br>
use cookies, or collect any information other than user login information,<br>
so these are purely mock-ups and serve no further purpose.<br><br> 

I'm just going to type random words at this point. Apple, banana,<br>
computer, window, bird, cat, house, desk, mouse, notebook, paper, wall.<br>
Sooner or later this should add up to 200 words, I think.<br><br>

For security reasons the information provided is false, any<br> 
images used are unrelated to me personally, and there may be<br>
some filler text here and there for when I run out of ideas.<br><br>
