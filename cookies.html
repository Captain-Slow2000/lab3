This website uses cookies (no it doesn't really). By using this website<br>
you are agreeing to our cookie policy (no you aren't). There will be cookies, and they will track<br> 
your web activity (again, no actual cookies). For what reason? I do not know. Maybe I just really want to see<br> 
your web activity (do not worry, I will not actually get that information).<br><br>

If we did use cookies we could collect data on the website's users and develop a better idea of<br> 
our primary demographic, and then tailor the website to the audience who uses the website the most.<br>
That's a pretty good use, I suppose. It ultimately benefits all parties involved.<br>
However, there are some companies that will go too far and actively take way too much information.<br>
If we did use cookies, we would not do that. Unless we really wanted to, but why would we? We're not<br> 
that mad with power... yet.<br><br> 

Real cookies are honestly better. Of course, if we ever use cookies, you will have the option to opt out,<br>
and that option would appear in this menu! We could also maybe work on a banner that appears when a user<br>
first enters the website providing a link to this page.<br><br>  

And that covers our totally real and absolutely legit and legal cookie policy! Enjoy using the website knowing<br>
we are not actually tracking you.<br><br>
