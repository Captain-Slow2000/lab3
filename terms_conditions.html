Welcome to the Terms and Conditions, where we will<br> 
discuss what rights you as an individual need to give up<br> 
to use our website!<br><br> 

No, not really, this website is free to use, free to navigate<br> 
through (I mean, charging for access to a portfolio, who even does that?),<br> 
and does not try to spy on you or take any of your<br> 
information. We do ask for some information if you want to<br> 
make an account with us, that being your name (first and last),<br>
email, and phone number, all of which are necessary if you want<br> 
the latest updates from my portfolio!<br><br>

As of right now the website does not remember account information,<br>
and therefore you cannot create an account yet. However, if you could,<br>
you would be able to opt out and delete your account at any time.<br><br>

We do ask that any images on the site not be repurposed or reused, and<br>
that sample work on the site not be copied or plagerized. Failure to comply<br>
will result in legal action, so hands off.<br><br> 

And that covers the terms and conditions for using my portfolio website!<br>
Just be sure to not violate them, or you will hear from my imaginary lawyer!<br><br>
