Contact me by email at fakeemail@email.com, or by phone at 555-5555.<br><br>
You will most likely not find me at the address listed below, as it was<br>
randomly generated. There's a chance I might be there at some point in my<br> 
lifespan, though that is highly unlikely. So please don't try to go there<br>
asking for me, the people who actually live and/or work there will likely<br> 
be very confused.<br><br>

The best time to contact me will be from the hours of 8:00 am to 8:00 pm<br>
Monday through Friday, and 11:00 am to 10:30 pm on weekends.<br>
I am usually pretty busy, so there is a chance I will miss your call.<br>
Please do not hesitate to leave a message. I will get back to you...<br>
eventually.<br><br>

As far as you know, and according to this map, I live at<br> 
2880 Broadway, New York, NY 10025. It's the internet, and<br>
that means it must be true!<br><br>

Down the street you can see Manhatten and Central Park, two<br> 
iconic locations located within the city of New York, a place I<br>
have absolutely been to and am not lying about visiting at all.<br><br>

You can also see a place called "Harlem" on the map. I wonder<br>
if that's where the "Harlem Shake" came from? It's one of life's<br> 
greatest mysteries.<br><br>
