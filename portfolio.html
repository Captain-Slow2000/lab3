Welcome to the portfolio!<br>
There is not a lot of stuff here now, but soon it will be<br>
full of things relating to my major and accomplishments here at<br>
university.<br><br>

Being a CS major, I could include links to several programs I have<br>
written over the semesters, demonstrating my undergraduate level knowledge<br>
of programming languages such as C, C++, Python, SML, and now, HTML.<br><br>

I may also include lists of extracurricular activities, and other things<br> 
I participate in now. I could also include a list of classes I have already<br>
taken or plan to take at university.<br><br> 

This being a portfolio means I could use it as a reference for potential<br>
employers. I could include a link on a resume or cover letter, so that if<br>
an employer is interested in hiring me, they could view my previous work.<br><br>

I could also include a section for previous employment. Even though<br>
not all my previous jobs relate directly to CS, like tech support, there<br> 
are other aspects from different jobs that employers might recognize, that<br> 
I could apply in a CS job.<br><br> 

Overall, if I were to use this portfolio professionally, I would want to<br> 
have it represent my work in CS, and that's why I would include things like<br>
programs, classes taken, previous jobs, and the like.<br><br>
